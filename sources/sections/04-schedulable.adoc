== Resource Object

A resource object definition SHOULD contain all information required to find the right resource.
For this, it SHOULD contain all, or a set of properties described in <<res_attrs>>. Additional
proprietary properties may be defined as well, but MUST begin with "X-". Clients encountering
properties they don't know about MUST ignore them.

Properties required to contact the resource are not included in this specification. vCard
properties defined in <<RFC6350>> can be used to include additional contact information for the
resource.
