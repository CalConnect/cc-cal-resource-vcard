Defining finer granularity of resource KIND - A schedulable resource might not exactly
correspond to a specific one in the list of pre-defined values for KIND. Question is how to
convey the additional information. Possibilities are extending KIND values to include all
combinations, defining an objectclass model where an object is built out of many pre-defined
KINDs, or defining standard parameter extensions to KIND to include more information.

Defining RESOURCETYPE - For a location resource, a new property LOCATIONTYPE was added to
provide more information. Are similar new properties required for non-location resources? Or do
we need a generic RESOURCETYPE property with a set of predefined values?
